                        <p>
                            I've been living in this apartment building for a little over a year now, and while there
                            are
                            some great aspects to it, there are also a couple of significant downsides.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the most significant advantages of this apartment building is its central location.
                            It's incredibly convenient to have easy access to downtown and all the amenities it offers.
                            Within walking distance, you'll find restaurants, shops, and public transportation, making
                            it ideal for those who want to enjoy city living.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, there are a couple of issues that have affected my overall satisfaction with
                            this place.
                            Firstly, the elevator has been a constant source of frustration. It breaks down
                            semi-regularly, and it
                            seems to happen about once a month on average. This can be especially inconvenient if you
                            live on one
                            of the higher floors. Waiting for repairs and having to climb multiple flights of stairs is
                            not something
                            you want to deal with regularly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Secondly, during the summer months, there is a noticeable problem with flies. It's not just
                            a minor annoyance;
                            it can be quite bothersome, especially if you like to keep your windows open to enjoy the
                            fresh air. This issue
                            should be addressed more proactively, as it affects the overall quality of living in the
                            building.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In conclusion, this apartment building has a lot of potential due to its central location,
                            but it definitely needs
                            improvement in certain areas. The elevator's frequent breakdowns are a major inconvenience,
                            and the summertime fly
                            problem is unpleasant. If these issues were addressed, it could be a much more attractive
                            place to live.

                            struggling to sleep.
                            Fortunately the building is on the 6th floor an so the noise is no where near as unbearable
                            as if you were on
                            the ground floor.

                            Secondly, during the summer months, there is a noticeable problem with flies. It's not just
                            a minor annoyance;
                            it can be quite bothersome, especially if you like to keep your windows open to enjoy the
                            fresh air. This issue
                            should be addressed more proactively, as it affects the overall quality of living in the
                            building.

                            In conclusion, this apartment building has a lot of potential due to its central location,
                            but it definitely needs
                            improvement in certain areas. The elevator's frequent breakdowns are a major inconvenience,
                            and the summertime fly
                            problem is unpleasant. If these issues were addressed, it could be a much more attractive
                            place to live.

                        <p>Unfortunately the bedrooms are on a fairly busy road and even at night you will find yourself

                            Fortunately the building is on the 6th floor an so the noise is no where near as unbearable
                            as if you were on
                            the ground floor.
